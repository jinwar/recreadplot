plot_recread.m Command List:

Nagivation:
x : Zoom in for time
y : Zoom in for dist
o : back one zoom level
O : reset zoom level and other setting.

Components and filters:
z : show BHZ component

t : show BHT component
l : low frequency band
m : middle frequency band
h : high frequency band
0 : raw data

Velocity Reduction:
v : turn on or off velocity reduction
p : pick the slowness of a phase
i : manually input the horizonal slowness for velocity reduction

Virtualization:
f : fill the area above zero
a + 1-9 : change the amplitude
n : change between individual normalize or global normalize
d : change between distance plot and azimuth plot
w : color traces based on azimuth
e : change azimuth range (type in)
b : plot all data or plot bin data (bin data only plots one trace in each bin, not stacking)
. : adding a marker or delete the existing one.
j : plot synthetic seismograms (must first run prepare_synthetics.m)

Other information:
/ : show station map within the distance range
c : bring out phase cheat sheet
C : new cheatsheet
k : get station data from IRIS and plots a map
